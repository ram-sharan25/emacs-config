;; --- 6. Global Keybinding for Creating a New Note ---
;; Bind to "Super-n" (Cmd-n on macOS, WindowsKey-n on Windows/Linux)
;; You can change "s-n" to your preferred global shortcut.
;; For example, if you have a personal prefix map like "C-c p", you could use "C-c p n".
;;(global-set-key (kbd "s-n") #'my-create-new-leetcode-note) ; "s" stands for Super/Cmd/Windows key
;; Alternatively, for a "C-c" based binding (less "global" but common for user commands):
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n") #'my-create-new-leetcode-note)
;; Note: C-c followed by a letter is often reserved for major modes.
;; Using Super key or a personal prefix map is safer for truly global bindings.
