;; --- 6. Global Keybinding for Creating a New Note ---

;; For example, if you have a personal prefix map like "C-c p", you could use "C-c p n".

;; Alternatively, for a "C-c" based binding (less "global" but common for user commands):
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c l") #'my-create-new-leetcode-note)
;; Note: C-c followed by a letter is often reserved for major modes.
;; Using Super key or a personal prefix map is safer for truly global bindings.
